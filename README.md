# Road Accident Dashboard Analysis
## Project Objective
To create a Road Accident Dashboard for the year 2022 to provide insights and visual analysis on key factors related to road accidents.
## Description
Created a Road Accident Dashboard in Excel, showing total casualties by severity, most affected vehicle types, monthly trends, road type distribution, and area-based statistics. It helps identify accident patterns and supports in decision making.
## Questions
- KPI's:
- Total Casualties & percentage of total with respect to accident severity.
- Maximum casualties by type of vehicle.
- Total Casualties with respect to vehicle type.
- Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties.
- Maximum casualties by Road Type.
- Distribution of total casualties by Area(urban/rural).
## Insights
- Vehicle Type with Maximum Casualties: Cars accounted for 80% of all casualties, indicating they were the most involved in accidents compared to other vehicle types like motorcycles, buses, and trucks.
- Monthly Trends: The monthly trend analysis shows a consistent number of casualties each month, with peaks observed in July and October.
- Casualties by Road Type: Most accidents occurred on single carriageways, accounting for 165,045 casualties. This suggests single carriageways may pose higher risks compared to dual carriageways and other road types.
- Casualties by Area: Urban areas had the highest number of casualties (60.6%), compared to rural areas (39.4%). This indicates a greater frequency of accidents in city areas.
